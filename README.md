# Install Tampermonkey
Tampermonkey is a browser extension that can be installed for Chrome. You can install Tampermonkey by going to [the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/related).

Tampermonkey allows for the installation and management of "Userscripts", which are the scripts designed for use with Tampermonkey. They are essentially just Javascript files. 

Once you have installed Tampermonkey, click on any of the following links to install one of the Userscripts in this repository. 

# Available userscripts
* [canvas_rubric_copy](https://github.com/mdccalex/helpful-canvas-scripts/raw/main/Tampermonkey%20Userscripts/canvas_rubric_copy.user.js) - Allows you to copy/duplicate rubrics between courses and accounts, with ability to select between courses/accounts by enrollment, sub-account admin, or root account admin.
* [canvas_grade_distribution](https://github.com/mdccalex/helpful-canvas-scripts/raw/main/Tampermonkey%20Userscripts/canvas_grade_distribution.user.js) - A dumb way of getting a grade distribution from gradebook that isn't fully automated. Lacks universality.
